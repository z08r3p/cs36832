Grade Calculation 
To   underscore the   belief that   learning   is a continuous   process and learning   how to   learn   is just as   important as   subject   matter   expertise, there is no midterm exam and no final exam. The   regular cadence   of weekly quizzes   and   complementary   course   assignments   and   activities   are designed to reinforce   knowledge at a steady   pace and   permit   a   more   measured   approach to   evaluating   student   performance.
Late Submissions: Any work – quizzes or assignments – that is   submitted   late will   receive   a   score   of zero   and will   not   be   evaluated.
If you would like to calculate your grade, use Canvas'   What-If   Grades   feature. What are What-If Grades? (https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-What-If-Grades/ta-p/25) 
Weekly Quiz on material from videos and reading (30% ) 
Each quiz is worth   5% of your final   grade.Students are required to complete a weekly quiz that   covers   the   assigned   reading   and   videos   for   the   week.   Students   can   only   take   the   weekly   quiz ONCE. You are   permitted to use the textbook and   your   notes when   taking   the   quiz. All   quizzes   must   be   completed   individually; working   in   groups   is NOT permitted. You are NOT permitted to   post any answers to the quiz on   any   of the forums. Any   instances of academic   dishonesty   will be reported   to   the   Dean   of   Students.You   must attempt the quiz   before the   11:59   pm   Friday deadline.   Failure to attempt the   quiz   before   the   deadline will   result   in   a   score   of zero. No exceptions and no excuses.   Because of the amount of time and the flexibility you   have   to   take   the   quiz,   last   minute   technical   problems   are   not      valid excuses.   I strongly recommend taking the quiz   before   Friday   night.
Weekly Lab Assignments (60 %) 
Each lab assignment is worth   10%   of your final   grade.
Each week students are required to complete a   lab   assignment   that   is   related   to   the week’s   material.   Lab   assignments   are   due   on   Sundays   at      11:59   PM.   Each student   must complete their own lab assignment; group   work   is   not   allowed.   The   format   of these   lab   assignments will   vary,   but   they typically consist of a lab report   around   800 words   (not   including tables   and   figures).   Expect   for   these   lab   assignments   to   take   up   the majority of your time spent on this class. They are graded   to very   high   standards.
Office Hour Attend ance ( 1 0 % ) 
You will   need to attend office   hours (online or in   person)   at   least three out of six weeks.   If you   cannot   make   any   of the   office   hour   periods,   email   me to set   up an alternative time. On Zoom, you   need   to   have   your video on.
